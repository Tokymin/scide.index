            <p>Monocular depth estimation in endoscopic environments is crucial for surgical video understanding, robotic navigation, and 3D reconstruction. However, existing discriminative approaches for depth estimation, often struggle with the challenging conditions of endoscopic imagery, such as complex illumination, narrow luminal spaces, and low-contrast surfaces, resulting in unreliable and inaccurate depth predictions. To address these challenges, we propose the Structure-Content Integrated Diffusion Estimation (SCIDE). Specifically, we introduce the Structure-Content Extractor (SC-Extractor), a module specifically designed to extract structure and content priors to guide the depth estimation process in endoscopic environments. The SC-Extractor effectively captures spatial cues from illumination patterns and wall contours, thereby enhancing robustness to challenging lighting conditions and improving overall depth accuracy. Additionally, we present the Fast Optimized Diffusion Sampler (FODS), an innovative sampling mechanism that leverages an optimization framework for adaptive time-step selection in diffusion probabilistic models. By minimizing the discrepancy between numerical solver approximations and ground-truth ODE solutions, FODS accelerates the inference process while maintaining high fidelity, making real-time application feasible in surgical settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our SCIDE framework not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy under challenging conditions but also significantly reduces inference time, providing an efficient and effective solution for real-time endoscopic depth estimation.</p>
